# dreamy-dot-files
My personal dot files

Some people were interested in seeing my dot files when I was live streaming from https://www.livecoding.tv/still_dreaming_1/. It will also be useful for me to be able to clone these to other machices or fresh OS installs. I have not decided if I will spend time reviewing pull requests, probably depends on how many this gets. I am more interested in keeping this useful for me than being general settings that would be good for everyone.
