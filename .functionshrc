# This file contains functions shared between bash and zsh

# thse are find functions. So they start with f. They use the -F option to prefent the search term from being treated as a regular expression. The "standard"
# version of these functions are also case insensitive. They all search recursively. They are basically used to find a search term across all files in a
# project without missing anything. The lack of case sensitivity helps not to miss anything, as does the lack of regular expression support since regular
# expressions are complicated and so often do not do what you think they do. Case sensitive versions of these search functions are provided for special case
# usage, but it is recommended not to use them except when they are specifically required

# find in php files
fp() {
	grep -Frin --include="*.php" "$@" .
}

# case sensitive version of fp
exact_fp() {
	grep -Fr --include="*.php" "$@" .
}

# find in web files
fw() {
	grep -Fri --include="*."{php,cs,html,js,css} "$@" .
}

# case sensitive version of fw
exact_fw() {
	grep -Fr --include="*."{php,cs,html,js,css} "$@" .
}

# find in C# files (fc is already taken. the n in fn is for .NET)
fn() {
	grep -Fri --include="*.cs" "$@" .
}
 
# case sensitive version of fn
exact_fn() {
	grep -Fr --include="*.cs" "$@" .
}

# find in all files
f_all() {
    grep -Fri "$@" .
}
